"𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐞-𝐓𝐮𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐘𝐎𝐋𝐎 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧"

This project is a fine-tuned model of 𝐘𝐎𝐋𝐎 specifically for aerial footage object detection. This advanced model leverages the powerful 𝐘𝐎𝐋𝐎 architecture, optimized for high-speed and accurate object detection in aerial video streams, by fine-tuning the model on a diverse dataset of drone-captured imagery. The 𝐕𝐢𝐬-𝐃𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐞 dataset is used for the fine-tuning.
